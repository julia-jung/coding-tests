#### Given two strings, find out

- if one includes the other (i.g. 'sadbutsad' includes 'sad')
- if one is **subsequence** of the other (means by deleting some letters in one, they can be identical not rearranging)

#### Given a string, find out

- if it is **palindrome** (means it reads the same forward and backward)

#### Given an array of number,

- find the max difference in order
- rotate the array by reversing
- remove occurance of specific value [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)
  -> looping through the array, put it into the pointer if it is not same with the value
- remove duplicates **in-place** from an array
  -> looping through the array, put it into the pointer if it is not same with the element before the pointer

#### Given two arrays of number,

- modify an array **in-place** to be merged two arrays in order
  -> fill larger element in from the end
