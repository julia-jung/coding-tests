# Algorithms

> An algorithm is a set of instructions or a step-by-step procedure used to solve a problem or perform a specific task

- Algorithms allow us to use data structures to perform an action to that data.
  - Data Structures(Class{}) + Algorithms(Function()) = Programs
- Algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science and are used extensively in software development, data analysis, and many other fields.

### When do I need to use them?

- In computer science, algorithms are typically used to solve computational problems, such as sorting a list of numbers, searching for a particular item in a database, or calculating the shortest path between two points on a graph

- They can be used whenever you need to perform a specific task that can be broken down into smaller, well-defined steps
  - Sorting data
  - Searching for information
  - Calculating mathematical functions
  - Optimizing performance
  - Machine learning

### What is an efficient algorithm?

- Algorithms are typically evaluated based on their efficiency, expressed in terms of time complexity and space complexity.

  - **Time Complexity** refers to the amount of time required for the algorithm to produce the output
  - **Space Complexity** refers to the amount of memory or storage required by the algorithm.

- With efficient algorithms, we can solve problems quickly and with fewer resources

## Types of Algorithms

- Recursion
- Sorting
- Searching
  - Binary Search
- Traversal
  - BFS (Breadth First Search)
  - DFS (Depth First Search)
- Dynamic Programming

## Problem-solving Strategy

### Divide and Conquer

> solves probelm by breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independenly, and then combining the solutions into a final solution for the original problem.

- This strategy is often used in computer science and mathematics to solve complex problems efficiently
- It is especially useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller, independent subproblems, as it enables parallelization and can reduce the overall tiem complexity of the algorithm.

#### Basic steps

1. Divide the problem into smaller subproblems.
2. Conquer each subproblem by solving them **recursively or iteratively**.
3. Combine the solutions of the subproblems into a solution for the original problem.

### Brute-force

### Greedy

### Backtracking

### Dynamic Programming
