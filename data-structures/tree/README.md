# Data Structure - Tree

## Concept

> A Tree is a non-linear data structure and a hierarchy constisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of tree stores _a value_ and _a list of references to other nodes('children')_

- Tree has roots, branches, and leaves connected with one another

  - _Root node_ is start of the tree and has no parent
  - _Leaf nodes_ are end of the tree and have no children

- The data in Tree are not stored linearly instead, they are arranged on multiple lavels or we can sy it is ahierarchical structure

- Tree is a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used more effectively
  - DOM also has tree data structure
