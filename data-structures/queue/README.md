## Stack

: is a data structure with the newest item on top and the oldest item is at the bottom and we can pop items up only through the top.
It means we always get the newest item first then the oldest item at last. (LIFO = Last In, First Out)

## Queue

: is on the other hand, a data structure with the oldest item in the front and the newest item at the end
and we can pop items up only through the front. It means we always get the oldest item first then the newest item at last.
(FIFO = First In, First Out)
