## Binary search

is an algorithm to find the index of the target value or where it would be if it were inserted in order.

The array must be sorted first.

The key is you repeately compare the target value to the midpoint to decide in which part(left or right) the target should be in.

It has O(log(n)) complexity

Binary search can be implemented either recursively or iteratively.
