## Hash Map (Hash Table)

is a data structure of key-value lookup

#### Given two strings, compares to check if

- one includes each latter of the other
- they are **isomorphic** (means the characters in one can be replaced to get the other. i.g. "egg" -> "add")
- one is an **anagram** of the other (means they can be identical by rearranging letters)
